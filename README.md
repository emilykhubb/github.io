# Emily Hubbard  
**Data Analyst | Excel • R • Statistical Modeling**

I build data-driven insights by combining strong statistical foundations with clear, practical analysis. My work focuses on cleaning complex datasets, selecting appropriate models, and communicating results that support real-world decision-making.

This portfolio features business-focused Excel analyses and applied R projects spanning regression, classification, machine learning, and unsupervised learning.

### R Projects
Applied statistical and machine learning projects demonstrating analytical depth, methodological rigor, and clear interpretation.

- **Religiosity and Lifetime Suicidality in Bipolar I**  
  Built a composite religiosity index and evaluated its association with lifetime suicidality using Firth penalized logistic regression to address small-sample bias.

- **Linear Regression Modeling with Transformations**  
  Modeled housing prices using transformed linear regression and diagnostic validation to improve predictive performance.

- **Multiple Linear Regression and Model Selection**  
  Applied AIC-based variable selection and regression diagnostics to model pizza delivery times.

- **Classification Models: Logistic Regression, LDA, and QDA**  
  Compared multiple classification approaches across medical and financial datasets using train/test evaluation.

- **Regularization and Dimensionality Reduction**  
  Used ridge, lasso, and PCA to address multicollinearity and uncover structure in high-dimensional data.

- **Machine Learning Classification Models**  
  Compared decision trees, ensemble methods, and SVMs to select models based on empirical performance.

- **Unsupervised Learning: Clustering Analysis**  
  Applied hierarchical and K-means clustering with formal cluster validation to analyze crime and urbanization patterns.
