## Project Overview

### 1. Religiosity and Lifetime Suicidality in Bipolar I  
**Penalized Logistic Regression Analysis**

Investigated the association between religiosity and lifetime suicidality among individuals with Bipolar I disorder using NSAL survey data. A composite religiosity index was constructed and evaluated using Firth penalized logistic regression to address small-sample bias.

**Key skills:**  
Logistic regression, composite index construction, bias-reduced estimation, small-sample inference, statistical interpretation

---

### 2. Linear Regression Modeling with Transformations  
**Housing Price Analysis**

Developed and evaluated multiple linear regression models to assess the relationship between housing prices and square footage using King County home sales data. Log and log–log transformations were applied to improve model fit and satisfy regression assumptions.

**Key skills:**  
Linear regression, transformations, diagnostic checking, model comparison, assumption validation

---

### 3. Multiple Linear Regression and Model Selection  
**Pizza Delivery Time Analysis**

Applied multiple linear regression to model delivery time using both numeric and categorical predictors. Backward variable selection via AIC was used to identify a parsimonious model, with performance evaluated through diagnostics and out-of-sample prediction.

**Key skills:**  
Multiple regression, categorical predictors, model selection, AIC, prediction error analysis

### 4. Classification Models: Logistic Regression, LDA, and QDA  

Compared multiple classification techniques across two case studies: leukemia survival prediction and stock market direction forecasting. Logistic regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) were evaluated using confusion matrices and misclassification rates.

**Key skills:**  
Binary classification, model comparison, train/test validation, odds interpretation, performance evaluation

---

### 5. Regularization and Dimensionality Reduction  

Explored ridge regression, lasso regression, and principal component analysis (PCA) to address multicollinearity and high-dimensional data. Applied regularization to brand choice prediction and PCA to crime data for structure discovery and interpretability.

**Key skills:**  
Regularized regression, cross-validation, multicollinearity handling, PCA, dimensionality reduction

---

### 6. Machine Learning Classification Models  

Trained and compared decision trees, ensemble methods (bagging, random forests, boosting), and support vector machines (SVMs) to predict consumer brand choice. Model selection was guided by empirical test accuracy and interpretability.

**Key skills:**  
Machine learning, tree-based models, ensemble methods, SVMs, model evaluation, performance comparison

---

### 7. Unsupervised Learning: Clustering Analysis  

Applied hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering to U.S. state crime and urbanization data. Optimal cluster selection was determined using the Gap statistic and elbow method, with results compared across clustering approaches.

**Key skills:**  
Unsupervised learning, clustering, distance metrics, cluster validation, PCA visualization, methodological comparison
