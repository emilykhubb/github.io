## Purpose
This tool provides a standardized way to evaluate project performance and calculate designer bonuses based on both qualitative and quantitative factors.

---

## Step 1: Set Up (Admin Tab — Done Occasionally)
Navigate to the **Admin** tab and confirm or adjust:
- Max Bonus Amount
- Weights (Subjective vs Objective)
- Sub-category weights
- Objective weights
- Mistake settings

✅ Ensure all weight totals equal **1.00**.

---

## Step 2: Add a New Project (Projects Tab)
- Go to the **Projects** tab
- Add a new row at the bottom of the table
- Enter values in the **blue cells only**

---

## Step 3: Enter Project Inputs

### Basic Info
- Project Name
- Designer

### Subjective Inputs
- Customer Score (1–5) *(leave blank if no survey response)*
- Boss Evaluation (Q1–Q5) *(use rubric sheet for guidance)*
- Mistakes *(total number of mistakes during the project)*

### Objective Inputs
- Hours *(total labor hours)*
- Profit ($) *(total project profit)*
- Target Profit ($) *(expected profit)*
- Target Efficiency ($/hr) *(expected profit per hour)*

---

## Step 4: Review Results (Automatic)
The spreadsheet will automatically calculate:
- Subjective Score (**Sub Var**)
- Objective Score (**Obj Var**)
- Final Score (**0–1 scale**)
- Bonus Amount (**$**)

---

## Step 5: Interpret the Results
- Higher scores indicate stronger overall performance
- A score of **1.00** represents maximum performance
- Bonus is calculated as:
Final Score X Max Bonus

---

## Important Notes
- Only edit **blue cells** — all others are calculated automatically
- If customer survey is missing, scoring adjusts automatically
- If you see:
  - **“MISSING HOURS”** → enter hours  
  - **“MISSING TARGET”** → enter target values  

---

## Best Practices
- Enter data as soon as a project is completed
- Set targets early in the project for consistency
- Use the Boss Evaluation Rubric for consistent scoring
