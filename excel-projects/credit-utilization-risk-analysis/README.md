# Credit Utilization Risk Analysis (Excel)

## Overview

This Excel-based analysis evaluates customer credit utilization patterns to identify high-risk segments and support data-driven credit risk decision-making. The project transforms raw account-level data into structured risk indicators and executive-ready visualizations.

The focus of this analysis is not just calculation, but segmentation, interpretation, and business insight generation.

## Data

- 10,000+ customer accounts
- Key variables:
  - Credit limit
  - Current balance
  - Credit utilization ratio
  - Income
  - Age
  - Account tenure

---

## Analytical Approach

### Data Preparation
- Data validation and cleaning using Excel formulas
- Calculation of credit utilization ratios
- Creation of utilization bands for risk segmentation
- Development of risk flags to identify high-exposure accounts

### Segmentation & Analysis
- Pivot tables and pivot charts to analyze utilization by:
  - Income
  - Age
  - Credit limit tier
- Correlation analysis between credit limit and utilization behavior (r ≈ −0.48)
- Identification of concentration risk across customer segments

### Visualization
- Executive-style dashboards designed for non-technical stakeholders
- Clear highlighting of high-risk customer groups and scale impact

---

## Key Findings

- High utilization rates are concentrated among customers with lower credit limits
- Younger and lower-income customers exhibit higher average utilization
- Credit utilization and credit limit show a moderate negative correlation (r ≈ −0.48)
- A relatively small subset of customers accounts for a disproportionate share of high utilization exposure
