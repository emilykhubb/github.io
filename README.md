# Emily Hubbard  
**Data Analyst | Excel • R • Tableau • Statistical Modeling**

I build data-driven insights by combining strong statistical foundations with clear, practical analysis. My work focuses on cleaning complex datasets, selecting appropriate models, and communicating results that support real-world decision-making.

This portfolio features business-focused Excel analyses, an interactive Tableau dashboard, and applied R projects spanning regression, classification, machine learning, and unsupervised learning.

### 📐 R Projects  
Applied statistical and machine learning projects demonstrating analytical depth, methodological rigor, and clear interpretation.

**Religiosity and Lifetime Suicidality in Bipolar I**  
Built a composite religiosity index and evaluated its association with lifetime suicidality using Firth penalized logistic regression to address small-sample bias.

**Linear Regression Modeling with Transformations**  
Modeled housing prices using transformed linear regression and diagnostic validation to improve predictive performance.

**Multiple Linear Regression and Model Selection**  
Applied AIC-based variable selection and regression diagnostics to model pizza delivery times.

**Classification Models: Logistic Regression, LDA, and QDA**  
Compared multiple classification approaches across medical and financial datasets using train/test evaluation.

**Regularization and Dimensionality Reduction**  
Used ridge, lasso, and PCA to address multicollinearity and uncover structure in high-dimensional data.

**Machine Learning Classification Models**  
Compared decision trees, ensemble methods, and SVMs to select models based on empirical performance.

**Unsupervised Learning: Clustering Analysis**  
Applied hierarchical and K-means clustering with formal cluster validation to analyze crime and urbanization patterns.
